This repo is a project for merging together natality / birth certificate microdata available from the CDC.

This is individual-level data on births, and includes demographic data on the parents, and medical information
about each birth.

The original public-use data is available here:
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/Vitalstatsonline.htm

However, the original data is in raw .dat format.  For the raw data to be meaningful, one must associate data
locations with variable names.  One could do this by downloading the User's Guide for each data set 
(available at the above link) and writing a program to read in the raw data.  Alternatively, you might  visit
the National Bureau of Economic Research's excellent website, and download the pre-formatted Stata data here:
