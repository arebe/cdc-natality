This repo is a project for merging together natality / birth certificate data available from the CDC.

The original public-use data is available here:
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/Vitalstatsonline.htm

However, the original data is in raw .dat format.  For the raw data to be meaningful, one must associate data
locations with variable names.  One cold do this by downloading the User's Guide for each data set 
(available at the above link) and writing a program to read in the raw data, or by visiting the National 
Bureau of Economic Research's most excellent website, and downloading the pre-formatted Stata data here:
